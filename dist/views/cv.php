            <h2 class="my-1 text-2xl font-semibold">Area of Interest:</h2>
            <p>I am interested in... <span class="font-semibold">Software Development, Web Development, Linux.</span></p><br>
            <ul class="list-disc">
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Software Development:</span> I have been using all kinds of software since a young age. From simple calculators to AAA videogames, all have piqued my interest. It's thanks to this lifetime exposure to software that I eventually ended up making my own. It started with calculators and eventually ended up with screen recorders and web browsers. I have a keen interest in the inner workings of software and happily spend my free time tinkering around with new languages and frameworks, seeing where might I end up today. <span class="italic font-semibold">[Specific area of interest: creating CLI tools using Go]</span></li><br>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Web Development:</span> I like making software that is accessible to all kinds of people, on all kinds of devices. I generally enjoy Web Development the most in my day-to-day activities. Making solid back-ends using PHP and Shellscript, all the while making pretty and comfortable front-ends using Tailwind and JS makes me consider things I normally wouldn't think about. UX/UI design, cross-compatibility for smaller devices such as mobile, tablet, but also larger devices such as 4K monitors and 8K televisions & the large amount of frameworks and tools to tinker with make Web Development the perfect playground for any developer - including me. <span class="font-semibold italic">[Specific area of interest: back-end using PHP]</span></li><br>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Linux:</span> My strongest interest lies in web back-end development. Thanks to this interest I use Linux frequently - everyday in fact. I run Linux on all of my servers (RPI cloud server, VPS webserver) and my personal desktop and laptop. It is my preferred work environment for all my day-to-day tasks. I don't know what specifically grasps me, it could be the terminal usage with the amazingly well-designed GNU commands, or it could be the customizability of a desktop environment such as GNOME or even a window manager such as i3. It could be the well-thought-out Linux workflow with redirects and pipelines, cronjobs and Vim galore. While I don't know what specifically has me coming back to this kind of environment everyday, I do know that it's something that I am most efficient at. <span class="font-semibold italic">[Specific area of interest: configuring cron, webserver and development environments using the terminal]</span></li>

            <h2 class="my-1 text-2xl font-semibold">Education:</h2>
            <p>I studied at... <span class="font-semibold">Landstede MBO, Deltion College.</span></p><br>
            <ul class="list-disc">
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Landstede MBO - Entree Zorg & Dienstverlening </span><span class="italic">[09-2020 - 07-2021]</span><br>My first MBO study was at Landstede. The study in question was MBO 1 Entree - Zorg & Dienstverlening. Here I learned how to properly work in a school environment. I also had my first internship here as an IT assistant.</li><br>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Deltion College - Software Developer @ ICT-Flex </span><span class="italic">[09-2021 - CURRENT]</span><br>At the time of writing this I am attending my second MBO study at Deltion College in Zwolle. My study is called Software Developer and it's given under a special department at Deltion called ICT-Flex. We're learning how to create, normalize and with with SQL databases, how to write a solid back-end using PHP and Laravel & how to write a good front-end using JS among other things. Other classes include Linux, Security & Project Management.</li>

            <h2 class="my-1 text-2xl font-semibold">Internships:</h2>
            <p>I interned at... <span class="font-semibold">ICT-Kringloop Zwolle, Landstede MBO.</span></p><br>
            <ul class="list-disc">
                <li><span class="font-semibold">ICT-Kringloop Zwolle </span><span class="italic">[09-2020 - 12-2020]</span><br>My first internship was at ICT-Kringloop Zwolle. Here I did basic QA by testing secondhand hardware. Closed by the end of the year due to COVID-19.</li><br>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Landstede MBO </span><span class="italic">[12-2020 - 07-2021]</span><br>My second internship was at Landstede MBO. Here I took up the role of IT assistant. I helped teachers and students with IT-related problems. For clarity: I wasn't an IT manager or anything. I did nothing related to AD or maintaining the school network. Instead I was tasked with on-site inspections and being a contactperson for IT-related questions. Activities include installing and updating computers within our network, helping people with miscellaneous issues such as internet connection not working, windows crashing and giving advice. I did this at two locations: Rechterland 1 and Rieteweg 12.</li>
